**Author's Note**: If you happen to stumble across this repository, I am terribly sorry. I do not maintain this code anymore; in fact, I'm not sure I cared about it after about 3 days. People have starred it, so maybe they actually like it, so it stays up. Venture forth at your own risk, as this was made by 2018 me who knew nothing about legitimate software development. Good luck.

# SplitterGenerator

A simple program that generates specific ratio splitters for Factorio!

## Usage

Simply execute the program, then follow the instructions as they appear in the program.
When you finish, you'll end up with a nice lil' splitter tree to build in-game! Simply merge
all the outputs with the same number or letter, then route all the 'X' splitters back to the
beginning! It's that simple!

## Issues? Requests?

If you have any issues whatsoever, please submit an issue. I would be more than happy to attempt
to resolve it. _Or_, if you think you can resolve it yourself, please feel free to do so! I'll
review the pull request and we'll add it in.
